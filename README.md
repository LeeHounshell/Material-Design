Material Design Final Project
=============================

I'm participating in the Udacity+Google Android Nanodegree program.
And this is the xyzReader RSS reader assignment for the Material-Design course.


## Description

This project implements a RSS feed viewer app that is modified for material design and multiple 'flavors.'

Functionally, this project takes a working app (with poor presentation) and gives it a material design face-lift.
This project replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's desgn as new standards are released.


## Features

 * Material Design Theme extends from AppCompat
 * CoordinatorLayout + AppBarLayout + CollapsingToolbar
 * Floating Action Button
 * Custom Styling featuring separation of interface into surfaces
 * Effective use of transitions and motion
 * Lint-Free Code
 * Free and Paid versions
 * A Gradle build 'preprocessor' which permits #IFDEF 'flavor' and #IFDEF 'buildType' in Android Java code
 * Google Analytics tracking
 * Memory Leak Detection
